# Models API Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Models API integration allows Geminize to retrieve and filter Google Gemini model information. This provides programmatic access to available models and their capabilities.

## Key Components

### Models::Model

- Enhanced with fields matching Google's API: name, base_model_id, version, display_name, etc.
- Added capability methods like `supports_content_generation?` and `supports_embeddings?`
- Implemented proper equality comparison

### Models::ModelList

- Added pagination support via `next_page_token`
- Implemented utility methods for filtering models by capability
- Added iteration support through Enumerable

### ModelInfo

- Added methods for retrieving models with pagination
- Implemented `list_all_models` for automatic pagination handling
- Added filtering methods like `get_models_by_method`
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing methods

### RequestBuilder

- Added methods for constructing models endpoint URLs
- Implemented pagination parameter support

### Client

- Added methods to interact with Models API endpoints
- Implemented proper error handling
- Added support for response pagination

### Main Module

- Added convenience methods for model filtering and retrieval
- Simplified commonly used operations

## Testing

- Created unit tests for all new components
- Implemented integration tests for the full flow
- Updated existing tests to maintain compatibility
- Added VCR cassettes for API interaction testing

## Documentation

- Added YARD documentation for all new methods
- Created example scripts demonstrating Models API usage
- Updated README to include basic Models API examples

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing model caching to reduce API calls
- Add smart model selection based on input requirements
- Develop model comparison utilities
